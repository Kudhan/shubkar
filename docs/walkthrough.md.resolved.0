# SHUBAKAR Project Walkthrough

## Completed Features

### 1. Project Architecture
- Monorepo structure (`backend`, `frontend`, `ai-budget-assistant`).
- Git initialized.
- Tech Stack: Node.js, React (Vite), Python, MongoDB.

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with User models (Customer, Vendor, Admin).
- **Vendor Management**: Profile creation, Admin approval workflow, and Search.
- **Booking System**: Event creation, Booking requests, Status management.
- **Real-time Chat**: Socket.IO integration for Booking-scoped chat rooms.

### 3. Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- **Design System**: Implemented SHUBAKAR design tokens (Coral, Turquoise, Yellow) and Typography.
- **Pages**:
  - **Home**: Landing page with Vendor Search.
  - **Auth**: fully functional Login and Register pages integrated with Backend API.
  - **Vendor**: Registration wizard (UI) and Vendor Search (UI).
  - **Dashboard**: Customer dashboard showing Event stats and Bookings (Mock Data).
  - **AI Planner**: UI for Budget estimation interfacing with the Python Service.

### 4. AI Service (Python)
- Flask app with `predict-budget` endpoint.
- Rule-based logic to estimate event costs based on Guest count and Type.

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
# Runs on localhost:5000
```

### AI Service
```bash
cd ai-budget-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Runs on localhost:5001
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs on localhost:5173
```

## Verification Results
- **Auth Flow**: Users can register and login. Token is stored in LocalStorage.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design following the "SHUBAKAR" brand guidelines.
- **AI Integration**: The AI Planner page sends requests to the Python service (ensure Python app is running).

## Next Steps
- Connect Dashboard and Vendor Search to live API endpoints.
- Implement file upload for Vendor Documents (using Multer).
- Deploy to Cloud (Vercel/Render).
